To solve this kind of problem, you may need to rely on your previous experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day when experimenting on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;, I got a strange print message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;output&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and could not figure out why for a while. Since I am using CLion and WSL 2, I soon realized that maybe it was the fault of CLion. So I ran the executable myself. A different print message came to my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time of thinking, I related to procedures of how shells work. When you type in a command and hit enter, the shell program first creates a process to run that command. The control soon returns to the shell after the command program is finished. However, if the command program creates a subprocess, and the subprocess is still running even if the main process has already returned, this can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to check my assumption, I decided to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; for the child process to finish. And this time it worked perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful of the environment you are using. Search the database in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Road Not Taken]]></title><description><![CDATA[BY ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one…]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/the-road-not-taken/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/the-road-not-taken/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:18:38 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BY ROBERT FROST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&lt;br&gt;
And sorry I could not travel both&lt;br&gt;
And be one traveler, long I stood&lt;br&gt;
And looked down one as far as I could&lt;br&gt;
To where it bent in the undergrowth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,&lt;br&gt;
And having perhaps the better claim,&lt;br&gt;
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;&lt;br&gt;
Though as for that the passing there&lt;br&gt;
Had worn them really about the same,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And both that morning equally lay&lt;br&gt;
In leaves no step had trodden black.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, I kept the first for another day!&lt;br&gt;
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,&lt;br&gt;
I doubted if I should ever come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere ages and ages hence:&lt;br&gt;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—&lt;br&gt;
I took the one less traveled by,&lt;br&gt;
And that has made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Guess who’s back, back again? Donald33 D.

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future. Oh, sometimes I retweet random stuff on the Retweets

&lt;p&gt;BY EDGAR ALLAN POE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,&lt;br&gt;
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—&lt;br&gt;
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,&lt;br&gt;
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.&lt;br&gt;
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;
Only this and nothing more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;&lt;br&gt;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.&lt;br&gt;
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow&lt;br&gt;
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—&lt;br&gt;
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—&lt;br&gt;
Nameless here for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain&lt;br&gt;
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;&lt;br&gt;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating&lt;br&gt;
“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—&lt;br&gt;
This it is and nothing more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,&lt;br&gt;
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;&lt;br&gt;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,&lt;br&gt;
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,&lt;br&gt;
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—&lt;br&gt;
Darkness there and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,&lt;br&gt;
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;&lt;br&gt;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,&lt;br&gt;
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”&lt;br&gt;
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—&lt;br&gt;
Merely this and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,&lt;br&gt;
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.&lt;br&gt;
“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;&lt;br&gt;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—&lt;br&gt;
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—&lt;br&gt;
’Tis the wind and nothing more!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,&lt;br&gt;
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;&lt;br&gt;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;&lt;br&gt;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,&lt;br&gt;
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,&lt;br&gt;
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,&lt;br&gt;
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—&lt;br&gt;
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,&lt;br&gt;
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;&lt;br&gt;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being&lt;br&gt;
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—&lt;br&gt;
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,&lt;br&gt;
With such name as “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only&lt;br&gt;
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.&lt;br&gt;
Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—&lt;br&gt;
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—&lt;br&gt;
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”&lt;br&gt;
Then the bird said “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,&lt;br&gt;
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store&lt;br&gt;
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster&lt;br&gt;
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—&lt;br&gt;
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore&lt;br&gt;
Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,&lt;br&gt;
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;&lt;br&gt;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking&lt;br&gt;
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—&lt;br&gt;
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore&lt;br&gt;
Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing&lt;br&gt;
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;&lt;br&gt;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining&lt;br&gt;
On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,&lt;br&gt;
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,&lt;br&gt;
She shall press, ah, nevermore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer&lt;br&gt;
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.&lt;br&gt;
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee&lt;br&gt;
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;&lt;br&gt;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—&lt;br&gt;
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,&lt;br&gt;
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—&lt;br&gt;
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—&lt;br&gt;
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!&lt;br&gt;
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—&lt;br&gt;
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,&lt;br&gt;
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—&lt;br&gt;
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—&lt;br&gt;
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!&lt;br&gt;
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!&lt;br&gt;
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!&lt;br&gt;
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting&lt;br&gt;
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;&lt;br&gt;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,&lt;br&gt;
And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;&lt;br&gt;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor&lt;br&gt;
Shall be lifted—nevermore!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TWENTY LESSONS ON FIGHTING TYRANNY FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY]]></title><description><![CDATA[By Timothy Snyder at Yale University Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or communism.

&lt;p&gt;By Timothy Snyder at Yale University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or communism. Our one advantage is
that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. From across the fearful twentieth century, here
are twenty lessons about what it takes to oppose tyranny, adapted to the circumstances of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1. Do not obey in advance.&lt;/code&gt; Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals
think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen
who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;2. Defend institutions.&lt;/code&gt; It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak
of “our institutions” unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. So
choose an institution you care about and take its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;3. Beware the one-party state.&lt;/code&gt; The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the
start. They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the
multi-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.&lt;/code&gt; The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the
swastikas and other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an
example for others to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;5. Remember professional ethics.&lt;/code&gt; When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just
practice become important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without
judges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in
cheap labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;6. Be wary of paramilitaries.&lt;/code&gt; When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing
uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader paramilitary
and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;7. Be reflective if you must be armed.&lt;/code&gt; If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know
that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to
say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;8. Stand out.&lt;/code&gt; Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But
without that unease, there is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell of the status
quo is broken, and others will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;9. Be kind to our language.&lt;/code&gt; Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even
if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet. Read
books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10. Believe in truth.&lt;/code&gt; To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power
because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for
the most blinding lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;11. Investigate.&lt;/code&gt; Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative
journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about
sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). Take responsibility for what you
communicate to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;12. Make eye contact and small talk.&lt;/code&gt; This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member
of society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom
you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological
landscape of your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;13. Practice corporeal politics.&lt;/code&gt; Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the
screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;14. Establish a private life.&lt;/code&gt; Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer
of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the Internet, or simply using it
less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;15. Contribute to good causes.&lt;/code&gt; Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life. Pick
a charity or two and set up autopay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;16. Learn from peers in other countries.&lt;/code&gt; Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present
difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend. And no country is going to find a solution by
itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;17. Listen for dangerous words.&lt;/code&gt; Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal
notions of emergency and exception. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.&lt;/code&gt; Modern tyranny is terror management. When the terrorist attack comes,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;19. Be a patriot.&lt;/code&gt; Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;20. Be as courageous as you can.&lt;/code&gt; If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

hesitating then no longer,<br>\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>\nDarkness there and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>\nMerely this and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>\n<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br>\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”</p>\n<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>\n<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br>\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>\n<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>\nShall be lifted—nevermore!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Raven","date":"April 05, 2021","update":"April 06, 2021"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/predictive-parser-and-left-recursive-grammar/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Can't a Predictive Parser Handle a Left-Recursive Grammar?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"971fd348-d86a-5ecf-9d64-fd4674f12353","previousPostId":"17ebde8e-2342-5613-8120-1fb1052f3476","nextPostId":"3081f45f-580a-5e68-a8e4-c03ddd6daf36"}},"staticQueryHashes":["277760381","2841359383","3204438775"]}

Our one advantage is\nthat we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. From across the fearful twentieth century, here\nare twenty lessons about what it takes to oppose tyranny, adapted to the circumstances of today.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">1. Do not obey in advance.</code> Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals\nthink ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen\nwho adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">2. Defend institutions.</code> It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak\nof “our institutions” unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. So\nchoose an institution you care about and take its side.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">3. Beware the one-party state.</code> The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the\nstart. They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the\nmulti-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.</code> The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the\nswastikas and other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an\nexample for others to do so.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">5. Remember professional ethics.</code> When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just\npractice become important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without\njudges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in\ncheap labor.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">6. Be wary of paramilitaries.</code> When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing\nuniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader paramilitary\nand the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">7. Be reflective if you must be armed.</code> If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know\nthat evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to\nsay no.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">8. Stand out.</code> Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But\nwithout that unease, there is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell of the status\nquo is broken, and others will follow.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">9. Be kind to our language.</code> Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even\nif only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet. Read\nbooks.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">10. Believe in truth.</code> To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power\nbecause there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for\nthe most blinding lights.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">11. Investigate.</code> Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative\njournalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about\nsites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). Take responsibility for what you\ncommunicate to others.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">12. Make eye contact and small talk.</code> This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member\nof society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom\nyou should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological\nlandscape of your daily life.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">13. Practice corporeal politics.</code> Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the\nscreen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">14. Establish a private life.</code> Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer\nof malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the Internet, or simply using it\nless. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">15. Contribute to good causes.</code> Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life. Pick\na charity or two and set up autopay.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">16. Learn from peers in other countries.</code> Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present\ndifficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend. And no country is going to find a solution by\nitself. Make sure you and your family have passports.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">17. Listen for dangerous words.</code> Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal\nnotions of emergency and exception. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.</code> Modern tyranny is terror management. When the terrorist attack comes,\nremember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power. Do not fall for it.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">19. Be a patriot.</code> Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">20. Be as courageous as you can.</code> If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TWENTY LESSONS ON FIGHTING TYRANNY FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY","date":"2021-01-07, 07:36 pm","update":"2021-04-19, 12:47 pm","description":"misc"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-raven/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Raven"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3e4619b5-e7d3-5e91-9c90-32b03a2d7fde","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"a60347f9-98be-560b-ab17-fa02b4eddebc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2598436127","2841359383","4151098094"]}

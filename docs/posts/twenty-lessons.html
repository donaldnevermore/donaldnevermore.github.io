<p>Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism or communism. Our one advantage is
that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. From across the fearful twentieth century, here
are twenty lessons about what it takes to oppose tyranny, adapted to the circumstances of today.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">1. Do not obey in advance.</code> Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals
think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen
who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">2. Defend institutions.</code> It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak
of “our institutions” unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. So
choose an institution you care about and take its side.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">3. Beware the one-party state.</code> The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the
start. They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the
multi-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.</code> The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the
swastikas and other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an
example for others to do so.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">5. Remember professional ethics.</code> When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just
practice become important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without
judges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in
cheap labor.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">6. Be wary of paramilitaries.</code> When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing
uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader paramilitary
and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">7. Be reflective if you must be armed.</code> If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know
that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to
say no.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">8. Stand out.</code> Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But
without that unease, there is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell of the status
quo is broken, and others will follow.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">9. Be kind to our language.</code> Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even
if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet. Read
books.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">10. Believe in truth.</code> To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power
because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for
the most blinding lights.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">11. Investigate.</code> Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative
journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about
sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). Take responsibility for what you
communicate to others.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">12. Make eye contact and small talk.</code> This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member
of society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom
you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological
landscape of your daily life.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">13. Practice corporeal politics.</code> Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the
screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">14. Establish a private life.</code> Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer
of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the Internet, or simply using it
less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">15. Contribute to good causes.</code> Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life. Pick
a charity or two and set up autopay.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">16. Learn from peers in other countries.</code> Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present
difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend. And no country is going to find a solution by
itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">17. Listen for dangerous words.</code> Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal
notions of emergency and exception. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.</code> Modern tyranny is terror management. When the terrorist attack comes,
remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power. Do not fall for it.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">19. Be a patriot.</code> Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come.</p>
<p><code class="nx-border-black nx-border-opacity-[0.04] nx-bg-opacity-[0.03] nx-bg-black nx-break-words nx-rounded-md nx-border nx-py-0.5 nx-px-[.25em] nx-text-[.9em] dark:nx-border-white/10 dark:nx-bg-white/10  " dir="ltr">20. Be as courageous as you can.</code> If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.</p><a href="https://github.com/donaldnevermore/donaldnevermore.github.io/issues" target="_blank">Reply to this post on GitHub</a><small style="display:block;margin-top:8rem" class="jsx-32c93ddbf1759959"><abbr title="This site and all its content are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License." style="cursor:help" class="jsx-32c93ddbf1759959">CC BY-NC 4.0</abbr> <time dateTime="2023-01-04T08:42:00.301Z" class="jsx-32c93ddbf1759959">2023</time> <!-- -->© donaldnevermore.<a href="/feed.xml" class="jsx-32c93ddbf1759959">RSS</a></small></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/twenty-lessons","query":{},"buildId":"8to6l2VhmwvtzctcA9gwu","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
